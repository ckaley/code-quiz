# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz - Modified to be a Sports Quiz

Instead of doing a code quiz, I applied the same criteria to do a Sports Trivia Quiz

## User Story

```
AS A coding bootcamp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```

## Approach

This was a bit of a challenge to code as there was a lot to take into account. Although I di complete the acceptance criteria, I did not complete the display of high scores list. I simply ran out of time. ALthoguh I don;t think I was too far from being able to do that.

### Review

You are required to submit the following for review:

- The URL of the functional, deployed application.

- The URL of the GitHub repository. Give the repository a unique name and include a README describing the project.
